Lumesquare: Stablecoin-Powered P2P Marketplace
Official Project Documentation
1. Executive Summary
Lumesquare is a decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace built on Solana that leverages stablecoins and smart contracts to eliminate fraud, reduce disputes, and provide a secure trading environment where buyers and sellers can transact with confidence. The project provides a comprehensive Rust SDK that allows developers to build secure P2P marketplaces with built-in trust mechanisms.

2. Problem Statement
Current P2P Marketplace Challenges:
Rampant Fraud: 1 in 6 Facebook Marketplace users report being scammed
Payment Risk: Traditional payment methods have weak buyer/seller protections
Trust Deficit: Limited verification of users' identities or item authenticity
Dispute Resolution: Centralized, slow, and often biased mediation processes
User Experience: Complex escrow solutions with high friction
Platform Dependency: Users rely on centralized moderators for security
Technical Barriers: Web3 solutions often require technical knowledge
Market Opportunity:
1B+ monthly shoppers use P2P marketplaces globally
$2T in annual transactions flowing through P2P commerce channels
30% of users avoid high-value P2P transactions due to security concerns
Solana's low fees enable microtransactions that would be prohibitive on other chains

6. Development Rules & Best Practices
Security Protocols:
No Hardcoded Credentials:
❌ const password = "secretPassword123"
✅ const password = process.env.DB_PASSWORD
Environment Variable Management:
Use .env files for local development
Never commit .env files to Git (.gitignore)
Provide .env.example templates with dummy values
Validate required environment variables on application startup
Sensitive Data Handling:
Never log sensitive information
Use parameter binding for all SQL queries
Implement proper input validation
Authentication Best Practices:
Use JWT with appropriate expiration
Implement wallet signature verification
Store only hashed data when needed
Code Quality Standards:
Typing and Interfaces:
Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
Avoid any type except where absolutely necessary
Implement proper error types
Error Handling:
Implement global error handler
Use custom error classes for different scenarios
Provide meaningful error messages
Testing Requirements:
Minimum 80% test coverage for backend code
Unit tests for all API endpoints
Integration tests for critical flows
Smart contract test coverage at 100%
