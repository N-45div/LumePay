<img src="docs/assets/logo.png" alt="LumePay Logo" width="200"/>

## Overview

LumePay is a revolutionary payment platform built on Solana that seamlessly bridges the gap between traditional fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. Our mission is to make financial transactions simple, fast, and accessible to everyone - regardless of their technical background or knowledge of blockchain technology.

Think of LumePay as a modern payment app like Venmo or Cash App, but with the added power of blockchain technology. When users want to send money to friends, family, or businesses, they don't need to know whether it's being processed as dollars or stablecoins - our smart transaction routing system handles all conversions automatically and intelligently.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Currency Support**: Send and receive money in various fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies.
- **Seamless Integration**: Connect your bank account or debit card for easy deposits and withdrawals.
- **Lightning-Fast Transactions**: Leverage Solana's blockchain for near-instant settlement times.
