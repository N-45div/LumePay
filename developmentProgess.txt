Let me provide a comprehensive summary of what we've developed so far in the StableFlow project. This will help maintain clear documentation of our progress and serve as a reference for future development.

Development Progress Summary for StableFlow

Current Implementation Status:
We have established the foundational components of our payment processing system, focusing on the core payment service and wallet management. Here's a detailed breakdown of our implementations:

1. Core Payment Service
Location: `apps/backend/src/services/core/payment/`
Main Components:
- `PaymentService.ts`: The central service handling payment processing
  - Implements comprehensive error handling
  - Supports both Solana and traditional payment networks
  - Integrates with wallet services for balance checking
  - Handles transaction creation and processing
  - Includes thorough validation of payment requests

2. Payment Interfaces and Types
Location: `apps/backend/src/services/core/payment/interfaces/`
- `payment.interface.ts`: Defines core interfaces including:
  - `PaymentRequest`: Structure for incoming payment requests
  - `PaymentResponse`: Structure for payment processing results
  - `IPaymentProcessor`: Contract for payment processing implementation

3. Error Handling System
Location: `apps/backend/src/services/core/payment/errors/`
- `PaymentErrors.ts`: Implements a hierarchical error system:
  - Base `PaymentError` class
  - Specific error types like `InsufficientFundsError`, `InvalidAddressError`
  - Network and transaction-specific error handling

4. Wallet Management
Location: `apps/backend/src/services/blockchain/solana/`
Components:
- `WalletService.ts`: Handles wallet operations
  - Wallet creation
  - Balance checking
  - Transaction signing
  - Integration with Solana blockchain

5. Wallet Interfaces
Location: `apps/backend/src/services/blockchain/solana/interfaces/`
- `wallet.interface.ts`: Defines wallet-related interfaces:
  - `WalletDetails`: Structure for wallet information
  - `IWalletService`: Contract for wallet service implementation

6. Utility Functions
Location: `apps/backend/src/utils/`
- `result.ts`: Generic Result type for error handling
- `logger.ts`: Centralized logging utility

Current Architecture Design:
We've implemented a modular architecture that:
- Separates concerns between payment processing and wallet management
- Provides clear interfaces for service implementations
- Includes comprehensive error handling
- Supports both Solana and traditional payment networks
- Follows TypeScript best practices for type safety

Next Steps in Development:
1. Database Integration:
   - Implement transaction persistence
   - Add wallet information storage
   - Enable transaction status tracking

2. API Layer:
   - Create REST endpoints for payment processing
   - Implement authentication and authorization
   - Add request validation

3. Monitoring System:
   - Implement transaction status monitoring
   - Add balance tracking
   - Create notification system for transaction updates

This implementation aligns with our project requirements and provides a solid foundation for building the complete payment platform. The code is structured to be maintainable, scalable, and follows best practices for a modern TypeScript/Node.js application.
